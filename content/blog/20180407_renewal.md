I've changed the generating engine of my website from Wordpress
to [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/)
with my original bibliography manager 
[morepo](https://github.com/aslemen/morepo).
The nice things about using a static website generator are
that you don't need CGI on your server, and that you can have a simpler way
of managing your contents.
The multi-lingual support of Hugo also impresses me a lot.

I'm now still working on migrating the contents from the old website,
which is taking more of my time.
