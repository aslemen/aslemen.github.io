I made a little attempt to give an implementation of some features of 
Heim &amp; Kratzer (1998) using Haskell,
which covers 
the semantic calculation of one-place predicates applied to entities and
generalized quantifiers applied to (pairs of) one-place predicates.

## Usage
Launch GHCi, load the source code below, and make your queries.

Examples:
```Haskell
Prelude> :l GQ.hs
Prelude> sleep Mary
False
Prelude> a student sleep
True
```

## Source code
Shown below.

- The object language is a fragment of clumsy English 
  (in cluttered word orders),
  sentences of which are actually nothing but Haskell expressions.
    - The (syntactic) categories of those expressions 
        are not overtly represented 
        since they are totally determined by the (semantic) types 
	of those interpretations.
       The "types" such as `Entity`ï¼Œ`Truth` belong to semantics.
- The meta-language is, of course, Haskell.
    - Based on _the functional talk_.
    - A certain trick is needed to enumerate the type constructors of
      `Entity`. The `Data.Data` module enables it.
- The interpreter of the meta-language is GHCi.
